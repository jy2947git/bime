#Python is used to program server level utilities and services.
#
#One of the use case of Python application is, on every Bime EC2 instance, we want a small messaging client listening to the queue and execute incoming commands.
#JMS is too big for this job and Java is not the best candidate when running System commands either. So, we choose Python for this purpose.
#
#Two protocols are available for Python coode to communicate to messsaging servers - STOMP and AMQP
#STOMP(Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol and AMQP (Advanced Meesaging Queue Protocol)
#
#We are using AMQP in our system.
#first download and install the AMQP Python Client Library
wget http://py-amqplib.googlecode.com/files/amqplib-0.6.1.tgz
tar zxvf amqplib-0.6.1.tgz
cd amqplib-0.6.1
sudo python setup.py install
