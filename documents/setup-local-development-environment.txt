Usually need to set a JAVA_HOME to the JDK installation path.
Verify JDK installation. Start a DOS command, enter "java -version", it should display the correct java version.

2, Eclipse 
Download latest eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/, choose the "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers", unzip to c: drive
start Eclipse by double-clicking the c:\\eclipse\eclipse.exe. You will be asked to enter the workspace name. Because this is the first time you run Eclipse, and you don't have the workspace directory yet, just enter "c:\\workspace",and Eclipse will create the new directory for you.

3, Tomcat
Download latest tomcat from http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi, choose the zip file. Unzip to c:
Configure Tomcat. Enter the tomcat/bin directory, edit the "catalina.bat" file. Add below after the "rem --------"
set JAVA_HOME=c:\\jdk1.6.0_17 (or whatever the path where jdk is installed)
Verify Tomcat. Start a DOS command, enter into tomcat bin directory, for example, c:/apache-tomcat-6.0.20/bin, run "startup.bat". You should see the tomcat start up messages. Should not see any errors. Start a browser, and try url http://localhost:8080, you should see the tomcat page.
Start another DOS command, enter to tomcat bin directory, and run "shutdown.bat", to shutdown the tomcat server.
Back to Eclipse to configure the tomcat. Choose "window" -> "Preferences". At left side of the Preferences window, expand "Server", and choose "Runtime Environments", click "Add" button.

keep mysql running.
MySql has default password for root, and we will need to change it to "G04theau" 
Start another window, enter into the mysql/bin directory, enter command "mysqladmin -u root password G04theau"
