# bime application is installed under /usr/local/bime-home/bime
# the labs are in /home/bime, for example, /home/bime/demo, /home/bime/lab3040
# (assume /home/bime is the home directory of bime user)
#
# bime user will be used to own the tomcat servers so tomcat application can write to the lab directory (upload file)

#
# first create a user account "bime", no password, can not use it to log on the linux server
#
sudo useradd --create-home -c "bime" bime

# create the Bime application directory in /usr/local
